Acceptance testing is both incredibly important and challenging to do well. In this session we'll explore both the theory and the tools to make it happen.

## Understanding Acceptance Testing

As a group let's go over the key ideas including:

* The purpose of acceptance testing
* How it differs from integration and unit testing
* Why it's difficult to write tests that last
* What's worth testing
* How accpetance tests can run against your app
* How a test is constructed and run
* Developing with a failing test

## Workshop

For the workshop portion, let's write some code. Starting with a small sample application, let's add on a layer of acceptance testing and use that to drive the development of a feature.
